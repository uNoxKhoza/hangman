 # Hangman Game in Python

This is a basic Hangman game developed using Python. It uses a text file that contains a list of words, from which one is randomly selected each time you play. The objective is to guess the correct word by suggesting letters, one at a time. You are allowed a maximum of 8 incorrect guesses. Correct guesses do not count against your total attempts, while each incorrect guess reduces your remaining chances by one.

Important: Ensure that all files, including the word list text file, are placed in the same directory as the Python script. Otherwise, the game will not run correctly.

Feel free to enjoy and explore this game! Contributions or improvements are always welcome and appreciated.
